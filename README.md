Live Notes
==========

*Live Notes* is an Android app that transcribes basic MIDI input, displays it on a score, and saves to the MusicXML format. Version 1.0 was completed for my senior thesis at the University of Northern Iowa.

Located in the "other" directory are a demo video, as well as an apk file to be installed on Android devices.

Contributions are welcome. If you wish to build *Live Notes* yourself, only the "evaluation" version can be built, not the "licensed" version. It will simply have a watermark over the score.
